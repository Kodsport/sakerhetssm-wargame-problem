title: ELF 101
description: |
  ELF if the standard format for executable binaries on Linux systems. Windows instead uses exe files, using the PE format. MacOS uses macho files for this, which are usually bunbled in application bundles with the .app extension.

  Many CTF challenges revolve around analyzing and taking apart ELF files. This is especially true in the <span style="font-style: italic;">pwn</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">reversing</span> categories.

  If you are not using Linux, you can generally not run ELF files. However, there are two easy ways to get a Linux system running on Windows or MacOS.

  In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span> you can install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Microsoft has a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">guide</a> for how to do this on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

  In both <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows and MacOS</span> you can install Linux in a virtual machine through VirtualBox. It's FOSS has a <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/">guide</a> for doing it on Windows but most of the steps are the same on MacOS as well.

  When you have access to a Linux system you can download and execute the file called <code>elf</code> to get the flag.
