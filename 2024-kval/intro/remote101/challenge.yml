title: Remote 101
description: |
  A large portion of communications over the internet today is done over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). To communicate using TCP, you need two computers, one server and one client. Once a connection has been established between two computer they can speak freely between each other. In many challenges in this competition, we will ask you to connect to an IP address and a port. One such example can be found below. The IP addressen identifies the computer we are connecting to and the port specifies which service on that computer we want to talk to.

  On many Linux systems you will find the tool <span style="font-style: italic;">netcat</span> pre-installed. On macOS you can download it using <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/netcat">brew</a> and on Windows it can be downloaded from <a href="https://nmap.org/ncat/">Nmap</a>. You can then use netcat through the command <code>nc</code> (<code>ncat</code> in the Windows terminal). Netcat is used to create a TCP connection directly to an IP address and port to communicate over the internet. Try connecting to the IP addressen and porten listed in this challenge description (displayed on the following format: <code>nc &lt;ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;</code>) by copying that command and running it in the terminal. Who know, maybe you'll get a flag. :o
