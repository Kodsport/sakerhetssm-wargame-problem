title: Lost On a Tree
description: The squirrel Chungus loves two things, big numbers, graph theory, and
  stealing flags. In fact, Chungus has just stolen the flag and got real whimsey on
  its way back to its nest. Chungus has somehow visited all branches of the ancient
  eXORcised tree, and dropped pieces of the flag while traversing the tree.
